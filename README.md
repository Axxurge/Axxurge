Bonjour/Hi! Name's Pascal, I'm a novice video game designer and developer here on GitHub.
I also have 10+ years of marketing experience under my belt, it's basically what allows me to invest time here.
Working mostly on Unity and HTML5/JS projects for now, looking to expand to UDK sometime in the future.
